# The Sparks Foundation Internship Task 2
### Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## OVERVIEW

#### This is a small project that was a part of my Data Science and Business Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. The dataset is consists of different features likesepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of the iris flower (all in cm). The idea is to use a K-means clustering model to segregate different categories of the iris flower based on the the aforementioned characteristics. This dataset is found in the scikit-learn's datasets module. It consists of 150 rows and 4 columns (for the different features).

## MOTIVATION

#### The motivation of working on this project is to know about the K-means clustering algorithm and to get hands-on experience on the same. This is a beginner level project that can get one learn how to use K-means algorithm using Scikit-learn, use data visualization libraries in Python, learn about within-cluster-sum-of-squares (WCSS), and how to use elbow method to decide the number of clusters in a dataset. These unsupervisd learning algorithms can be useful when the user has no information about the patterns in the dataset. Such a project can be helpful in scientific researches to know about different existing species based on the data that is recorded.

### TECHNICAL ASPECT

#### The following libraries have been used in this project-

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikit-learn


### FLOW
